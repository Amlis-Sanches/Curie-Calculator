# Curing Calculator Program
## Overview
The Curing Calculator Program is a versatile tool designed to calculate the activity of a radioactive item. By leveraging various inputs, users can determine key variables such as activity in Curies, the mass of a solution, half-life, and other isotope-specific properties. The program is designed for flexibility, allowing users to explore relationships between key variables in decay equations.

## Features
- **Activity Calculations:** Quickly calculate activity in Curies (Ci) or determine the mass of an isotope.
- **Input Flexibility:** Use different combinations of inputs (e.g., half-life, isotope weight, decay constant) to solve for other variables.
- **Data Integration:** Includes preloaded data from two authoritative resources for ease of selection and accurate calculations. [^1] [^2]
    If needed, you are able to replace the data within the program to provide your own dataset.
- **Manual Input:** Perform manual calculations for custom data points not covered in the provided datasets.
- **Data Review:** View and analyze isotope data directly from built-in charts and tables.

## Usage
This program provides an intuitive interface to input relevant data and immediately view the results. Whether you are performing a quick calculation using preloaded datasets or entering custom values for specialized use cases, the Curing Calculator Program is designed to simplify complex calculations.

## Applications
Determining the activity of isotopes for research or industrial purposes.
Estimating the required mass or activity for specific applications.
Reviewing isotope data for scientific or educational purposes.

## Resources
The data used in this program is derived from trusted sources to ensure accuracy and reliability. These datasets make it easy to perform calculations with minimal manual data entry. The two data sources were pulled from the National Nuclear Data Center [^2] and the Nuclear Data Services [^1] websites.
